# Planit

Planit is a web-based travel planner integrated with Gen AI.

# Problem Statement:
Traveler goes to an unfamiliar area and needs recommendations on places to visit. Through the use of GenAI, come up with a list of sightseeing sites, restaurants and interesting events for that specific place. Through user feedback, the AI should filter through desired suggestions and undesired suggestions. Then, these desired suggestions will be parsed and marked on a map along with an itinerary.

## Persona:
Kelly travels to San Jose for a week, and she is new to the area. She asks "What is there to do for 3 days while I am in San Jose, I am new to the area?" The application should generate items following:

Check out a local sports team venue?
If confirmed: Hockey? Football? Soccer? Basketball?
Check out a San Jose Sharks game.

Visit San Francisco for a day?
If confirmed: Food to try? Museums? Shopping?
Try some clam chowder at Fisherman’s Wharf
Exploratorium
