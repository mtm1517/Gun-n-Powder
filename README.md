# Gun n' Powder
an Automated AI-Enhanced Penetration Testing Platform

# Problem Statement:
Build an AI-driven penetration testing platform that automates the simulation of cyber-attacks to identify system vulnerabilities in real time.
Use OWASP vulnerability list to generate types of cyber-attacks.

## Persona:
Tom is a beginner cybersecurity analyst and he has been tasked with finding Cross-Site-Scripting and SQL injections issues. These two vulnerabilities are very prevalent in modern times often showing up in OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities. He will like something that can simplify the process of finding vulerabilities. The tool is designed to integrate AI with penetration testing of these two vulnerabilities.
