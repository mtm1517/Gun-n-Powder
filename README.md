# Planit

Planit is a web-based food recommendation program, leveraging computer vision and GenAI.

# Problem Statement:
Aimed specifically at young adults who are starting to live independently but may not have the skill and expertise to plan out food for themselves.

## Persona:
Gerald is an 18 years old who has recently been admitted into SJSU and is now living on his own. He has moved far away from home into a city where he now has to do everything for himself. Spaghetti and instant ramen are his daily diet and he is tired of eating them. While he goes grocery shopping occasionally, he struggles with planning out various meals with the ingredients he has in his fridge. He lacks the expertise and know-how to make diverse cuisines and doesn't want to spend money on eating out. So he takes a picture of the contents inside his refrigerator and uploads the image to the application. The application will then recommend a list of easy-to-make and diverse meals for Gerald.
